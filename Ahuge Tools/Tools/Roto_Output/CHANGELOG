    # ---- CHANGELOG ---- #
	
	Tool Name: 					RotoOutput.nk
	Current Version : 			1.6

	Notable additions:
								Rewrote node logic to be lighter on the system. It was causing bugs in a network linked copy of nuke
								Wrote a knobChanged() script to look for changes of knobs in the Roto Output node only and no long check the entire script every time a knob was changed
								Found a new way to calculate the borders in the Borders mode
	Known Bugs:
								The logic inside will not update if a Roto Output changes upstream until the mode is changed in this node
	Planned Updates:
								Merge the Packer tool and the Roto Output node
	Notes:
								Version 1.6 is the first version in the GitHub package
