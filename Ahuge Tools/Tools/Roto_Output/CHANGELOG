	Tool Name: 					
								RotoOutput.nk
	Current Version : 			
								1.6.1

	Notable additions:
								Added a button to create a backdrop on the node attached to the roto input.
								If the roto input is not plugged in, it will create the backdrop over the plate's input.
								If nothing is plugged in, it will warn you and tell you to plug something in
								Fixed the math for my random colours in the backdrop script
								Created a random checkbox so that you can get a random colour
	Known Bugs:
								The logic inside will not update if a Roto Output changes upstream until the mode is changed in this node
	Planned Updates:
								Merge the Packer tool and the Roto Output node
	Notes:
								Version 1.6.1 is the second version in the GitHub package
