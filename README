Ahuge Tools currently supports versions of nuke 6.3v4 and up but as tools are created I may end up needing to drop support for older versions



    # ---- Installation ---- #

Included with each build will be a menu.py and an init.py
These are meant to make it easy to import the tools and scripts.



    Windows

For installation on Windows, place the menu.py, init.py and the Ahuge Tools folder in "C:\Users\yourName\.nuke"
If you have moved your User directory to another drive, replace the "C" with the appropriate drive letter


	Mac

On Mac OSX the .nuke directory is hidden. You can open it using the following command in the terminal:
"open /Users/username/.nuke"
once in this folder, you can copy the menu.py, init.py and the Ahuge Tools folder into it


	Linux

On Linux the .nuke directory is usually "/home/username/.nuke"
once you've found this folder, you can copy the menu.py, init.py and the Ahuge Tools folder into it


    Restarting Nuke will reload the plugins and add them to your copy of nuke.
